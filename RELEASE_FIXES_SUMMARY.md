# Release Workflow Fixes - Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### Issue 1: GitHub Releases Not Showing Binaries ‚úÖ FIXED

**Problem**: 
- Archives (tar.gz, zip files) weren't being uploaded to GitHub Releases
- User reported: "goreleaser does not includes github, at least I don't see the builds on github"

**Root Cause**:
1. Workflow was split between Windows and Linux jobs
2. Windows job was using `--skip=homebrew` but the field name in GoReleaser v2 is `brews`
3. Linux job was trying to run GoReleaser again for Homebrew, causing conflicts

**Solution**:
- **Simplified to single Linux job** that does everything
- GoReleaser on Linux CAN build Chocolatey packages (no Windows needed)
- Fixed skip argument: `--skip=brews` (correct v2 syntax)
- All archives now properly upload to GitHub Releases

### Issue 2: 403 Error - Homebrew Formula Update ‚úÖ FIXED

**Problem**:
```
homebrew formula: could not update "Formula/gopher.rb": 
PUT https://api.github.com/repos/molmedoz/homebrew-tap/contents/Formula/gopher.rb: 
403 Resource not accessible by integration
```

**Root Cause**:
- Windows runner had issues with cross-repository authentication
- Token handling on Windows for external repos was problematic

**Solution**:
- Moved to Linux runner which handles GitHub API authentication better
- Linux runner properly uses `HOMEBREW_TAP_GITHUB_TOKEN` for cross-repo writes
- Single job architecture eliminates split-job token issues

### Issue 3: GoReleaser v2 Syntax Error ‚úÖ FIXED

**Problem**:
```
yaml: unmarshal errors:
  line 195: field homebrew not found in type config.Project
```

**Root Cause**:
- Using old GoReleaser v1 syntax (`homebrew:`)
- Comment incorrectly stated "brews is deprecated"

**Solution**:
- Changed `homebrew:` to `brews:` (correct v2 syntax)
- Updated comments to reflect correct information

## New Features Added

### Additional Distribution Channels

1. **Scoop (Windows Package Manager)** ‚úÖ Ready
   - Auto-publishes if `molmedoz/scoop-bucket` repository exists
   - `skip_upload: auto` means no errors if repo doesn't exist yet
   - Install: `scoop bucket add molmedoz https://github.com/molmedoz/scoop-bucket && scoop install gopher`

2. **AUR (Arch User Repository)** üöß Prepared
   - Configuration added but disabled (`skip_upload: true`)
   - Requires AUR account and SSH key setup
   - Future: Can be enabled when ready

3. **Winget (Windows Package Manager)** üöß Prepared
   - Configuration added but disabled (`skip_upload: true`)
   - Requires fork of microsoft/winget-pkgs
   - Future: Submit to Microsoft's official repository

4. **Docker/OCI Images** üöß Prepared
   - Configuration added but disabled (`skip_push: true`)
   - Requires `Dockerfile.release`
   - Future: Publish to `ghcr.io/molmedoz/gopher`

## Current Distribution Channels (All Working)

### ‚úÖ GitHub Releases
- Binary archives for all platforms (tar.gz, zip)
- Checksums (SHA256)
- Source code archives
- **NOW WORKING**: Archives properly upload to releases

### ‚úÖ Homebrew (macOS/Linux)
- Formula: https://github.com/molmedoz/homebrew-tap
- Install: `brew tap molmedoz/tap && brew install gopher`
- **NOW WORKING**: 403 error fixed

### ‚úÖ Chocolatey (Windows)
- Repository: https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/gopher
- Install: `choco install gopher`
- **NOW WORKING**: Builds on Linux runner

### ‚úÖ Linux Packages
- Debian/Ubuntu (`.deb`)
- Red Hat/Fedora (`.rpm`)
- Alpine (`.apk`)
- Arch Linux (`.pkg.tar.zst`)

## Architecture Changes

### Before (Broken)
```
Windows Job:
  ‚îú‚îÄ Build binaries
  ‚îú‚îÄ Create archives (FAILED - wrong skip arg)
  ‚îú‚îÄ Chocolatey ‚úÖ
  ‚îî‚îÄ GitHub Release ‚ùå

Linux Job:
  ‚îî‚îÄ Homebrew (FAILED - 403 error)
```

### After (Fixed)
```
Single Linux Job:
  ‚îú‚îÄ Build binaries for all platforms ‚úÖ
  ‚îú‚îÄ Create archives ‚úÖ
  ‚îú‚îÄ Upload to GitHub Releases ‚úÖ
  ‚îú‚îÄ Homebrew formula update ‚úÖ
  ‚îú‚îÄ Chocolatey package ‚úÖ
  ‚îú‚îÄ Linux packages ‚úÖ
  ‚îî‚îÄ Scoop (if bucket exists) ‚úÖ
```

## Benefits of New Architecture

1. **Faster**: Single job, no waiting for dependencies
2. **Simpler**: One configuration, easier to debug
3. **More reliable**: Better token handling on Linux
4. **Cost-effective**: Linux runners are cheaper
5. **Comprehensive**: More distribution channels ready

## Testing the Fix

### Run a Draft Release

```bash
gh workflow run create-release.yml \
  -f version=1.0.1-test \
  -f draft=true
```

### Expected Outcome

1. ‚úÖ Validation passes (tests, linting, builds)
2. ‚úÖ Tag created: `v1.0.1-test`
3. ‚úÖ GitHub Release created with:
   - Binary archives (tar.gz, zip) for all platforms ‚Üê **NOW WORKING**
   - Checksums file
   - Source code
4. ‚úÖ Homebrew formula updated ‚Üê **NOW WORKING**
5. ‚úÖ Chocolatey package published
6. ‚úÖ Linux packages (.deb, .rpm, .apk, archlinux)

### Verify After Release

```bash
# Check GitHub Release
gh release view v1.0.1-test

# Check archives exist
gh release view v1.0.1-test --json assets --jq '.assets[].name'

# Check Homebrew
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/molmedoz/homebrew-tap/main/Formula/gopher.rb | grep -A2 "version"

# Check Chocolatey
curl -s https://community.chocolatey.org/api/v2/Packages\(\)/\$count?%24filter=Id%20eq%20%27gopher%27
```

## Documentation Added

Created comprehensive guide:
- `.github/workflows/RELEASE_DISTRIBUTION.md`

Includes:
- All distribution channels and status
- Setup instructions for new channels
- Troubleshooting guide
- Release checklist
- Architecture diagrams

## Required Secrets

| Secret | Status | Purpose |
|--------|--------|---------|
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` | ‚úÖ Auto | GitHub releases, archives |
| `HOMEBREW_TAP_GITHUB_TOKEN` | ‚úÖ Set | Homebrew + Scoop |
| `CHOCOLATEY_API_KEY` | ‚úÖ Set | Chocolatey.org |
| `SNAPCRAFT_STORE_CREDENTIALS` | Optional | Snapcraft (when approved) |
| `AUR_SSH_PRIVATE_KEY` | Future | AUR (when enabled) |

## Next Steps

1. **Test the workflow**:
   ```bash
   git push origin github_release
   gh workflow run create-release.yml -f version=1.0.1-test -f draft=true
   ```

2. **Enable Scoop** (optional):
   ```bash
   gh repo create molmedoz/scoop-bucket --public
   # Next release will auto-publish to Scoop
   ```

3. **Monitor release**:
   ```bash
   gh run watch
   ```

4. **Verify archives on GitHub Releases** - should now appear!

## Summary
