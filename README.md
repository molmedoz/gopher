A simple, fast, and lightweight Go version manager written in Go. Gopher enables you to install, manage, and switch between multiple Go versions, including your system-installed Go.

> üìö **New to Gopher?** Start with the [**Quick Reference**](QUICK_REFERENCE.md) for a one-page overview, or explore the [**Complete Documentation Index**](DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md) to find exactly what you need!

- üåç **Cross-platform**: Works on Linux, macOS, and Windows
- üì¶ **Lightweight**: Zero third-party dependencies (only official Go extended packages)
- üîÑ **Auto-cleanup**: Automatically manages old versions to save space
- üè† **System Integration**: Seamlessly manages both system and Gopher-installed Go versions
- üìä **JSON Support**: Full JSON output for scripting and automation

## Compatibility

Gopher is designed to work across multiple platforms and Go versions:

| Gopher Version | Supported Go Versions | Platforms | Architecture |
|----------------|----------------------|-----------|--------------|
| v1.0.0+ | 1.20+ | Linux, macOS, Windows | x86, x64, ARM, ARM64 |

**Platform Support:**
- ‚úÖ **Linux**: All major distributions (Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, CentOS, Arch, etc.)
- ‚úÖ **macOS**: Intel and Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3/M4)
- ‚úÖ **Windows**: Windows 10/11 with Developer Mode enabled

**Go Version Support:**
- Manages any Go version from 1.20 onwards
- Can detect and manage system-installed Go versions
- Supports pre-release and beta versions

## Dependencies

Gopher is designed to be lightweight with minimal dependencies:

**Runtime Dependencies:**
- ‚úÖ **Zero third-party dependencies** - No external packages from unknown sources
- ‚úÖ **Official Go packages only** - Uses golang.org/x/term (official Go extended library)

**Dependency Details:**
```
golang.org/x/term v0.36.0
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Purpose: Terminal capabilities (TTY detection, width detection)
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Maintained by: Go team (official)
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Size: ~100KB
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Why: Better UX (auto-sizing progress bars, reliable cross-platform behavior)
```

**Why golang.org/x/term?**
- Industry standard (used by Docker, kubectl, cobra, and most Go CLI tools)
- Better Windows compatibility than stdlib alternatives
- Automatic terminal width detection (prevents line wrapping)
- Reliable TTY detection (progress bars only show when appropriate)

**Future:** We track "Pure Standard Library Implementation" as a very low priority item in our [roadmap](docs/ROADMAP.md#phase-6-pure-standard-library) for those who prefer zero external dependencies.

## Installation

### Package Managers (Recommended)

#### **macOS:**
```bash
# Using Homebrew (recommended)
brew install molmedoz/tap/gopher

# Or in two steps:
# brew tap molmedoz/tap
# brew install gopher
```

#### **Windows:**
```powershell
# Using Chocolatey
choco install gopher
```

#### **Linux:**
```bash
# Using Snap (all distributions)
sudo snap install gopher --classic

# Or download binary from releases
# See: https://github.com/molmedoz/gopher/releases
```

### Go Install

```bash
go install github.com/molmedoz/gopher/cmd/gopher@latest
```

### From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/molmedoz/gopher.git
cd gopher
go build -o gopher cmd/gopher/*.go
sudo mv gopher /usr/local/bin/
```

### Interactive Setup

Run the setup wizard to automatically configure gopher for your platform:

```bash
gopher init
```

This will:
- Detect your platform and current configuration
- Check for required dependencies (Developer Mode on Windows, Homebrew on macOS, etc.)
- Test symlink creation and PATH configuration
- Provide platform-specific next steps

### Platform-Specific Guides

- **Windows:** See [Windows Setup Guide](docs/WINDOWS_SETUP_GUIDE.md) for detailed instructions
- **All Platforms:** See [User Guide](docs/USER_GUIDE.md) for complete documentation

## Usage

### Basic Commands

```bash
# Interactive setup wizard
gopher init

# List installed Go versions (including system)
gopher list

# Install and switch to a Go version
gopher install 1.21.0
gopher use 1.21.0

# Switch to system Go
gopher use system

# Show current Go version
gopher current

# Uninstall a Go version
gopher uninstall 1.20.7

# Show detailed help
gopher help
```

### Environment Management

```bash
# Configure GOPATH mode
gopher env set gopath_mode=shared

# Show environment variables for a version
gopher env show go1.21.0

# Reset to defaults
gopher env reset
```

### Interactive Pagination

Both `list` and `list-remote` commands feature interactive pagination by default:

```bash
# Interactive mode (default)
gopher list
gopher list-remote

# Navigate with:
# - Enter or 'n': Next page
# - 'p': Previous page  
# - Number: Jump to specific page
# - 'q': Quit
# - 'h': Help

# Disable interactive mode
gopher --no-interactive list
gopher --no-interactive list-remote
```

### JSON Output

All commands support JSON output for scripting (flags must come before the command):

```bash
gopher --json list
gopher --json current
gopher --json system
```

### Visual Indicators

The `list` command shows clear visual indicators for the active version:

```bash
# Active version is highlighted with arrow and [active] flag
gopher list
# Output:
#   go1.24.7 (darwin/arm64) [system]
#   go1.22.0 (darwin/arm64)
#   go1.22.1 (darwin/arm64)
# ‚Üí go1.23.0 (darwin/arm64) [active]
```

### Verbosity Control

Control output verbosity with command-line flags:

```bash
# Default: INFO level
gopher list

# Verbose: DEBUG level (shows detailed information)
gopher --verbose install 1.21.0
gopher -v install 1.21.0

# Quiet: ERROR level only (minimal output)
gopher --quiet list
gopher -q list
```

### GOPATH Modes

Gopher supports three GOPATH modes:

**Shared Mode (Default)**
```bash
gopher env set gopath_mode=shared
# All Go versions share the same GOPATH
```

**Version-Specific Mode**
```bash
gopher env set gopath_mode=version-specific
# Each Go version has its own isolated GOPATH
```

**Custom Mode**
```bash
gopher env set gopath_mode=custom
gopher env set custom_gopath=/path/to/workspace
# Use a custom GOPATH location
```

### Configuration

Gopher stores its configuration in:
- **Linux/macOS**: `~/.gopher/config.json`
- **Windows**: `%USERPROFILE%\gopher\config.json`

Default configuration:
```json
{
  "install_dir": "~/.gopher/versions",
  "download_dir": "~/.gopher/downloads",
  "mirror_url": "https://go.dev/dl/",
  "auto_cleanup": true,
  "max_versions": 5
}
```

## Examples

### Basic Workflow

```bash
# Run interactive setup (first time)
gopher init

# Install and switch to Go 1.21.0
gopher install 1.21.0
gopher use 1.21.0

# Verify installation
go version

# List all versions
gopher list

# Switch to system Go
gopher use system
```

### Scripting with JSON

```bash
# Get current version in JSON format
current_version=$(gopher current --json | jq -r '.version')
echo "Current Go version: $current_version"
```

## Configuration

Gopher stores its configuration in:
- **Linux/macOS**: `~/.gopher/config.json`
- **Windows**: `%USERPROFILE%\gopher\config.json`

### Environment Variables

- `GOPHER_CONFIG`: Path to custom configuration file
- `GOPHER_INSTALL_DIR`: Custom installation directory
- `GOPHER_DOWNLOAD_DIR`: Custom download directory

For detailed configuration options, see the [User Guide](docs/USER_GUIDE.md#configuration).

## Development

```bash
# Clone and build
git clone https://github.com/molmedoz/gopher.git
cd gopher
go build -o gopher cmd/gopher/main.go

# Run tests
go test ./...

# Run with custom config
gopher --config /path/to/config.json list
```

## Security

- All downloaded Go binaries are verified using SHA256 checksums
- Downloads are performed over HTTPS from official Go mirrors
- Minimal dependencies (only official Go packages) reduce the attack surface
