## üéØ Testing Strategy Overview

### **Three-Tier Testing Approach**

1. **Automated Tests** (Already passing ‚úÖ)
   - Unit tests
   - Integration tests
   - Security tests

2. **Docker Container Tests** (Pre-configured ‚úÖ)
   - Linux (Ubuntu, Debian, Alpine)
   - macOS simulation
   - Windows simulation

3. **Native Platform Tests** (Manual/CI)
   - Real Linux machines
   - Real macOS machines
   - Real Windows machines (VM)

---

## üê≥ Docker Testing (Recommended First Step)

### **Available Docker Test Scenarios**

#### **Linux/Unix Tests**
```bash
# Test on Unix-like system WITHOUT pre-installed Go
make docker-test-unix-no-go

# Test on Unix-like system WITH pre-installed Go
make docker-test-unix-with-go
```

#### **macOS Tests** (Linux-based simulation)
```bash
# Test on macOS-like environment WITHOUT pre-installed Go
make docker-test-macos-no-go

# Test on macOS-like environment WITH pre-installed Go
make docker-test-macos-with-go
```

#### **Windows Tests** (Wine-based simulation)
```bash
# Test Windows build WITHOUT pre-installed Go
make docker-test-windows-no-go

# Test Windows build WITH pre-installed Go
make docker-test-windows-with-go

# Test Windows in simulated environment
make docker-test-windows-simulated
```

#### **Run All Docker Tests**
```bash
# Build all Docker images and run all tests
make docker-build
make docker-test
```

---

## üî¨ Comprehensive Testing Plan

### **Phase 1: Quick Verification (10 minutes)**

#### **1. Build Verification**
```bash
# Build the project
make build

# Verify binary exists
ls -lh build/gopher

# Test basic commands
./build/gopher version
./build/gopher help
```

#### **2. Unit Tests**
```bash
# Run all unit tests
make test

# Run with coverage
make test-coverage

# Run verbose tests
make test-verbose
```

#### **3. Security Checks**
```bash
# Run security scan
make security-scan

# Check for vulnerabilities
make vuln-check

# Run all security checks
make security-all
```

---

### **Phase 2: Docker Testing (30-60 minutes)**

#### **Step 1: Build Docker Images**
```bash
# Build all Docker test images
make docker-build

# This will create:
# - gopher-test-unix-no-go
# - gopher-test-unix-with-go
# - gopher-test-macos-no-go
# - gopher-test-macos-with-go
# - gopher-test-windows-no-go
# - gopher-test-windows-with-go
```

#### **Step 2: Run Automated Docker Tests**
```bash
# Test each scenario
make docker-test-unix-no-go
make docker-test-unix-with-go
make docker-test-macos-no-go
make docker-test-macos-with-go
make docker-test-windows-no-go
make docker-test-windows-with-go

# Or run all at once
make docker-test
```

#### **Step 3: Manual Docker Testing**

**For Linux/Unix:**
```bash
# Enter the container
docker run -it gopher-test-unix-no-go /bin/bash

# Inside container, test commands
/gopher/build/gopher version
/gopher/build/gopher list
/gopher/build/gopher list-remote --page-size 5
/gopher/build/gopher install 1.21.0  # Test installation
/gopher/build/gopher list            # Verify installed
/gopher/build/gopher use 1.21.0      # Test version switching
/gopher/build/gopher current         # Verify active version
/gopher/build/gopher system          # Check system Go
/gopher/build/gopher alias create stable 1.21.0  # Test aliases
/gopher/build/gopher alias list
/gopher/build/gopher uninstall 1.21.0  # Test uninstall
exit
```

**For macOS Simulation:**
```bash
# Enter the container
docker run -it gopher-test-macos-no-go /bin/bash

# Run the same test commands as above
```

**For Windows Simulation:**
```bash
# Enter the container (if interactive mode works)
docker run -it gopher-test-windows-simulated /bin/bash

# Test Windows-specific paths and behavior
```

4. Check symlink created: ~/.gopher/current -> versions/go1.21.0
```

### **Version Switching Verification**
```bash
# After switching version
1. Check symlink updated: ~/.gopher/current points to correct version
2. Check go command works: go version shows correct version
3. Check GOROOT set correctly: echo $GOROOT
4. Check GOPATH set correctly: echo $GOPATH
```

### **Persistence Verification**
```bash
# Test persistence across shell sessions
