# Release Process

This document describes how to create and maintain releases for Gopher.

## Release Workflow

### 1. Prepare Release

#### Update Version Number
```bash
# Decide on version number (semantic versioning)
# MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
# - MAJOR: Breaking changes
# - MINOR: New features (backward compatible)
# - PATCH: Bug fixes

export VERSION="v1.1.0"
```

#### Update CHANGELOG.md
```bash
# Move content from [Unreleased] to new version section
# 1. Change [Unreleased] header to [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD
# 2. Add new empty [Unreleased] section at top
# 3. Review and organize changes
```

**Template:**
```markdown
## [Unreleased]

### Added
### Changed
### Deprecated
### Removed
### Fixed
### Security
```

#### Update docs/RELEASE_NOTES.md
```bash
# 1. Change "Upcoming" version to actual version with date
# 2. Change status from "In Development" to "Released"
# 3. Add new "Upcoming" section for next version
# 4. Review and polish content
```

#### Run Pre-Release Checks
```bash
# 1. Run all tests
make ci

# 2. Build for all platforms
make build-all

# 3. Run E2E tests
bash test/e2e.sh

# 4. Check documentation
make help | grep -E "(clean|purge|ci)"

# 5. Validate release
make validate-release TAG=$VERSION
```

### 2. Create Release

```bash
# 1. Commit all changes
git add -A
git commit -m "chore: prepare release $VERSION"

# 2. Create and push tag
make create-tag TAG=$VERSION

# 3. Push changes

```

### 3. GitHub Release

The GitHub Actions workflow will automatically:
1. Build binaries for all platforms

3. Edit release notes if needed
4. Publish release

# Update formula in molmedoz/homebrew-tap

# Chocolatey (when available)
# Update package in molmedoz/chocolatey-packages

## Automation Tips

VERSION=$1
if [ -z "$VERSION" ]; then
    echo "Usage: $0 v1.1.0"
    exit 1
fi

# Update CHANGELOG.md
sed -i '' "s/## \[Unreleased\]/## [$VERSION] - $(date +%Y-%m-%d)/" CHANGELOG.md

# Update RELEASE_NOTES.md
sed -i '' "s/Upcoming/$(date +"%B %Y")/" docs/RELEASE_NOTES.md
sed -i '' "s/In Development/Released/" docs/RELEASE_NOTES.md

# Commit
git add CHANGELOG.md docs/RELEASE_NOTES.md
git commit -m "chore: prepare release $VERSION"

echo "‚úì Release prepared for $VERSION"
echo "Next: make create-tag TAG=$VERSION"
```

### Use Makefile

Already integrated! See:
- `make validate-release TAG=vX.Y.Z`
- `make create-tag TAG=vX.Y.Z`
