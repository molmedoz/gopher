# Release Process

This document describes how to create and maintain releases for Gopher.

## Release Workflow

### 1. Prepare Release

#### Update Version Number
```bash
# Decide on version number (semantic versioning)
# MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
# - MAJOR: Breaking changes
# - MINOR: New features (backward compatible)
# - PATCH: Bug fixes

export VERSION="v1.1.0"
```

#### Update CHANGELOG.md
```bash
# Move content from [Unreleased] to new version section
# 1. Change [Unreleased] header to [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD
# 2. Add new empty [Unreleased] section at top
# 3. Review and organize changes
```

**Template:**
```markdown
## [Unreleased]

### Added
### Changed
### Deprecated
### Removed
### Fixed
### Security
```

#### Update docs/RELEASE_NOTES.md
```bash
# 1. Change "Upcoming" version to actual version with date
# 2. Change status from "In Development" to "Released"
# 3. Add new "Upcoming" section for next version
# 4. Review and polish content
```

#### Run Pre-Release Checks
```bash
# Run local validation
make prepare-release VERSION=1.0.0

# This checks:
# - All tests pass with race detection
# - Linter passes
# - Code is formatted
# - Imports are clean
# - Everything builds
```

### 2. Create Release via GitHub Actions

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: We use GitHub Actions workflow for releases (NOT manual tags)**

```bash
# 1. Commit all changes
git add -A
git commit -m "chore: prepare release $VERSION"

# 2. Push to your branch
git push origin your-branch

# 3. Create and merge PR to master

# 4. After merge, go to GitHub Actions
# https://github.com/molmedoz/gopher/actions/workflows/create-release.yml

# 5. Click "Run workflow"
# 6. Enter version (e.g., 1.0.0)
# 7. Choose options (draft/prerelease)
# 8. Click "Run workflow"
```

### 3. Automated Release Process

The GitHub Actions workflow will automatically:
1. ‚úÖ Validate version format
2. ‚úÖ Check tag doesn't already exist
3. ‚úÖ Verify version exists in CHANGELOG.md
4. ‚úÖ Run all tests with race detection
5. ‚úÖ Run linter (golangci-lint)
6. ‚úÖ Build for all platforms
7. ‚úÖ Create tag (ONLY if all above pass)
8. ‚úÖ Run GoReleaser
9. ‚úÖ Extract release notes from CHANGELOG
10. ‚úÖ Create GitHub Release
11. ‚úÖ Upload all artifacts

**Key Benefit:** Tag is created AFTER validation, not before!

#### Manual Steps (if needed)
1. Go to https://github.com/molmedoz/gopher/releases
2. Find the auto-created release
3. Edit release notes if needed
4. Publish release

### 4. Post-Release

#### Update Package Managers
```bash
# Homebrew (when available)
# Update formula in molmedoz/homebrew-tap

# Chocolatey (when available)
# Update package in molmedoz/chocolatey-packages

# AUR (when available)
# Update PKGBUILD in molmedoz/aur-gopher
```

#### Announce Release
- Tweet/social media
- Update website
- Notify users
- Update documentation
