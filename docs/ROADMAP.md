```bash
gopher profile create myproject --go-version 1.21.0
gopher profile use myproject
gopher profile list
gopher profile delete myproject
```
**Benefits**: Different projects need different Go versions, automatic switching
**Implementation**: Profile storage, directory-based detection, automatic switching

### 5. **Automatic Version Detection** ‚≠ê High Priority
```bash
gopher auto-detect            # Detect Go version from go.mod
gopher use --from-go-mod      # Use version from go.mod
```

```
**Benefits**: Better integration with Go's module system
**Implementation**: Go module file manipulation, version synchronization

### 7. **Backup & Restore** ‚≠ê Medium Priority

---

## üéì **Phase 6: Pure Standard Library** (Philosophical Goal - Long-term)

### 18. **Remove External Dependencies** ‚≠ê Very Low Priority
```bash
# Goal: Implement terminal handling using only Go standard library
# Remove golang.org/x/term dependency
```
**Benefits**:
- True "zero dependencies" marketing claim
- Full control over all code
- Educational value (understanding terminal protocols)
- Slightly smaller binary size

**Implementation**:
- Custom TTY detection using `os.Stat()` and `os.ModeCharDevice`
- Terminal width from `COLUMNS` environment variable or fixed width
- Platform-specific terminal control (if absolutely needed)
- Maintain same UX quality as current implementation

**Current Dependencies** (Honest Assessment):
- `golang.org/x/term v0.36.0` - Official Go extended package
  - Used for: TTY detection (`term.IsTerminal`)
  - Used for: Terminal size (`term.GetSize`)
  - Why: Better UX (auto-sizing), more reliable than stdlib alternatives
  - Industry standard: Used by Docker, kubectl, cobra, etc.

**Trade-offs**:
- ‚úÖ Pure stdlib implementation
- ‚ùå Less reliable TTY detection (especially Windows)
- ‚ùå No automatic terminal width (potential line wrapping)
- ‚ùå More platform-specific code to maintain
- ‚ùå Worse UX compared to current implementation

**Recommendation**: Keep current implementation. The use of official Go extended packages is industry-standard and provides significantly better UX. This is listed as lowest priority for philosophical completeness, not practical necessity.
