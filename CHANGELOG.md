  - Reusable formatters package (bytes, speed, percentage)
  
- **Developer Experience**
  - JSON output support for all commands
  - Verbose and quiet modes
  - Interactive setup wizard (`gopher init`)
  - Makefile-based local CI (`make ci`, `make test`, `make lint`)
  - Shell-based E2E tests (19 scenarios across platforms)
  - Comprehensive documentation suite
  - Detailed roadmap with prioritized features
  
- **Maintenance Commands**
  - `gopher clean` - Remove download cache to free disk space
  - `gopher purge` - Complete removal of all Gopher data with confirmation
  
- **Development Tools**
  - `make install-tools` - Automatically install goimports, golangci-lint, and gofumpt
  - `make check-format` - Check code format without modifying (CI mode)
  - `make check-imports` - Check imports without modifying (CI mode)
  - `make ci` - Run complete CI workflow locally (matches GitHub Actions)
  - Automatic tool path resolution (no PATH configuration needed)
  
### Distribution
- **Homebrew**: Available via `brew install molmedoz/tap/gopher` (macOS/Linux)
- **Linux Packages**: Debian (.deb), RedHat (.rpm), Alpine (.apk), Arch (.pkg.tar.zst)
- **GitHub Releases**: Pre-built binaries for all platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows, ARM)
- **Direct Download**: All platforms can download from GitHub Releases
- **Chocolatey**: Coming in v1.0.1+ (requires Windows build runner)
- **Snap**: Pending Snapcraft name approval (will be added in future release)

### Technical Improvements
- **Testing**: All tests include `-race` flag by default for race condition detection
- **Makefile**: Tools use full paths from GOPATH/bin (no PATH setup required)
- **CI/CD**: Version injection added to all GitHub Actions builds
- **CI/CD**: Race detection added to all test workflows
- **CI/Local Parity**: `make ci` matches GitHub Actions exactly
- **Dependencies**: Uses `golang.org/x/term` for enhanced terminal support
- **Testing**: 50+ unit tests with 35% coverage + 19 E2E test scenarios
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions workflows for lint, test, build, security, coverage
- **Architecture**: Modular design with reusable components
- **Thread Safety**: Mutex-protected concurrent operations in alias manager
- **Cross-platform**: Platform-specific optimizations for Windows, macOS, and Linux
- **Security**: Security scanning with gosec, vulnerability checks with govulncheck

### Commands Available
- `gopher list` - List installed Go versions (with aliases shown inline)
- `gopher list-remote` - List available Go versions with pagination
- `gopher install <version>` - Install a Go version
- `gopher uninstall <version>` - Uninstall a Go version
- `gopher use <version>` - Switch to a Go version
- `gopher use system` - Switch to system Go
- `gopher current` - Show current Go version
- `gopher system` - Show system Go information
- `gopher clean` - Remove download cache to free disk space
- `gopher purge` - Complete removal with confirmation

### User Experience Improvements
- Visual progress bars for downloads (auto-sized to terminal width)
- Animated spinners for long operations (extraction, uninstall)
- Aliases shown inline in `gopher list` output for quick reference
- Version normalization (omit 'go' prefix in all commands)
- Graceful handling of missing/corrupted alias files
- Clean, professional terminal output
- No interference between progress indicators and other output
- Better Windows terminal compatibility

### Fixed
- Windows progress bar issues (progress bars now update on same line)
- Windows spinner compatibility (animations work correctly)
- Terminal width detection prevents line wrapping
- TTY detection for better piped output handling
- Race conditions in concurrent alias operations (added mutex protection)
- Alias file format migration (old array to map format)
- Empty/missing alias file handling
- Flag parsing order in CLI
- JSON output for empty lists
- Test panic recovery output in CI
